## Summary
### Lecture 1:
- What is machine learning?
- Examples of machine learning (in Chemistry)
- Introduction to unsupervised learning:
   - Clustering (k-means and others)
   - How does actual input data look like?
- Molecular fingerprints and nomenclature
Introduction to supervised learning:
- What is a classification problem?

### Lecture 2:
- Unsupervised learning continued:
   - Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
   - t-SNE
- Regressions
- Classifications in practice:
   - Random Forests
   - Multilayer perceptrons 


## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the main pillars of machine learning
- Know about different clustering techniques as part of unsupervised learning
- Be able to use common nomenclature used in machine learning
- Use Principle component analysis to reduce the dimensions of a data set
- Understand how a regression problem can be cast as a machine learning problem 
- Be aware of how random forests and multilayer perceptrons can be used in a classification problem
